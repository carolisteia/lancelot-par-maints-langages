> This repository hosts the training data and aligned outputs for a multilingual medieval tradition.

## 📚 Description

This repository contains a subset of aligned witnesses from the *Lancelot en prose*, one of the core cycles of the Arthurian literary tradition. The corpus is multilingual (Old French, Castilian, Italian) and has been segmented and aligned using the [Aquilign](https://github.com/ProMeText/Aquilign) pipeline, a BERT-based tool for multilingual clause-level alignment of medieval texts.

## 🧰 Alignment Tool

The corpus was processed using **Aquilign**, a multilingual alignment tool developed by the [ProMeText](https://github.com/ProMeText) team.  
The texts were first segmented into clauses (`<cl>`) with custom-trained token classification models, and then aligned based on contextual embeddings.

- Alignment model: `LaBSE` (Language-Agnostic BERT Sentence Embedding)
- Languages: Old French, Old Spanish (Castilian), Old Italian
