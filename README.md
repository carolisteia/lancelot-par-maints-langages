# üìú Across Languages, Lancelot Rides  
*Tracing Lancelot‚Äôs journey not only through lands and courts, but through languages, manuscripts, and time.*

> An aligned multilingual corpus of the *Lancelot en prose*, processed with [Aquilign](https://github.com/ProMeText/Aquilign).


## üìö Description

This repository contains training and evaluation data for the study of the multilingual medieval textual tradition of the *Lancelot en prose*, including manually corrected alignments and automatically generated outputs.

It features a curated selection of witnesses from the *Lancelot en prose*, one of the core cycles of the Arthurian literary corpus. The texts are presented in multiple medieval languages‚ÄîOld French, Old Spanish (Castilian), and Old Italian‚Äîand have been automatically segmented and aligned using the [Aquilign](https://github.com/ProMeText/Aquilign) pipeline, a BERT-based tool for multilingual clause-level alignment of medieval texts.

In addition to alignment outputs, the repository includes manual corrections and evaluation files to support philological analysis and computational validation.

## üßæ Context and Corpus Description

This project is part of a broader study on **computational multilingual alignment and stemmatological analysis** of medieval texts. The case study focuses on the *Lancelot en prose*, a major prose romance composed anonymously in the early 13th century. With at least 126 surviving manuscript witnesses and numerous translations, the *Lancelot* represents one of the most widespread and complex textual traditions of medieval Europe.

This corpus includes aligned segments from the Romance tradition‚Äîspecifically:
- **Old French (source)**,
- **Castilian (Old Spanish)**, and
- **Old Italian**.

Due to the unstable and fragmentary nature of transmission, only **comparable segments** from selected witnesses were retained. Alignment is performed at the **clause (‚Äúsentence‚Äù) level**, preceded by a segmentation step using a custom-trained model. The aligned outputs are then used for **variant classification** and **stemmatological exploration**.

### Source Witnesses

The aligned corpus includes:

- **Lancellotto** (Italian): Florence, Biblioteca della Fondazione Ezio Franceschini, 1 (late 14th c.)
- **Lanzarote** (Castilian): Madrid, BNE, MS 9611 (copied from a 1414 exemplar)
- **Five French witnesses**, including:
  - Paris, BnF, fr. 111 (15th c.)
  - Paris, BnF, fr. 751 (13th c.)
  - Editions based on:
    - London, BL, Add. 10293
    - Cambridge, CCCC 45
    - Oxford, Bodleian Library, Rawlinson D. 899
  - The 1488 incunabula edition (Paris, BnF, RES-Y2-46 and RES-Y2-47)

Only three comparable segments were retained and aligned:
- `ii-48`, `ii-61`, and `iv-75`, based on the structure of the Micha edition.

## üß∞ Alignment Tool
The corpus was processed using **Aquilign**, a multilingual alignment tool developed by the [ProMeText](https://github.com/ProMeText) team.

- **Segmentation**: Performed at the clause level using custom token classification models.
- **Alignment**: Based on contextual embeddings using [LaBSE](https://github.com/google-research/bert/blob/master/multilingual.md).
- **Languages**: Old French, Old Spanish (Castilian), Old Italian
